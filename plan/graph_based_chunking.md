# Graph-Based Chunking for Technical Documentation Retrieval

This document outlines an approach to graph-based chunking for improved retrieval in technical documentation systems, with a specific focus on developer documentation for blockchain platforms like Aptos and Move.

## Current Approach vs. Graph-Based Enhancement

### Current Approach

Most RAG systems for technical documentation rely primarily on semantic similarity between query and chunks, with some hierarchical information used for post-retrieval enrichment. This approach has limitations:

- It misses important contextual information from document structure
- It doesn't leverage sequential relationships between chunks
- It fails to capture code/concept dependencies that are critical for understanding

### Graph-Based Enhancement

Graph-based chunking creates and utilizes multiple relationship types between content chunks, enabling more intelligent traversal of documentation during retrieval. This leads to more comprehensive, contextually relevant results.

## Types of Relationships in Technical Documentation

For developer documentation, especially for blockchain platforms, the following relationship types are most valuable:

### 1. Structural Hierarchy

- **Document Structure**: Parent-child from document nesting (modules → classes → methods)
- **Code Structure**: Package → module → class → method hierarchy
- **Example**: When a developer asks about `aptos_move::call_function()`, they likely need context from the parent module

### 2. Sequential Context

- **Adjacent Chunks**: For installation steps, tutorials, or multi-step explanations
- **Example**: When retrieving a step in a transaction creation process, the steps before and after provide essential context

### 3. Semantic Relationships

- **Similar Implementation Patterns**: Code examples implementing similar concepts
- **Related Concepts**: Chunks discussing related theoretical concepts
- **Example**: Connecting "resource accounts" with "resource account creation" and example implementations

### 4. Referential Links

- **Import/Usage Relations**: Which components use or are used by this component
- **Prerequisite Knowledge**: What concepts must be understood first
- **Example**: When explaining Move modules, linking to type abilities which affect how they can be used

### 5. Blockchain-Specific Relationships

- **On-chain/Off-chain Components**: Connecting on-chain code with off-chain interactions
- **Smart Contract Interfaces**: Linking contract definitions with their transaction builders
- **Error-Solution Pairs**: Common errors with their solutions

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Enhanced Metadata During Preprocessing

During the chunking and embedding phase, enrich chunks with relationship metadata:

```json
{
  "id": "move_module_123",
  "content": "module my_addr::counter { ... }",
  "metadata": {
    "parent_id": "move_package_45",
    "children_ids": ["function_inc_234", "function_dec_235"],
    "sequence_position": 3,
    "section": "smart_contract_basics",
    "content_type": "code_definition",
    "code_language": "move",
    "references": ["resource_account_89", "table_storage_56"],
    "referenced_by": ["transaction_builder_567", "example_counter_678"],
    "dependencies": ["std::signer", "aptos_framework::coin"],
    "error_codes": ["E001", "E002"],
    "implementations": ["example_impl_789", "advanced_impl_790"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Graph Traversal During Retrieval

When retrieving content, use a multi-stage process:

1. **Initial Retrieval**: Standard semantic search based on query
2. **Graph Expansion**: Traverse relationships to gather relevant context
3. **Relevance Reranking**: Combine and rerank results considering both semantic similarity and relationship strength

```python
def enhanced_graph_retrieval(initial_chunks, chunk_map, traversal_depth=1):
    """Expand retrieved chunks using graph relationships"""
    enhanced_results = set(initial_chunks)

    for chunk in initial_chunks:
        chunk_id = chunk.get("id")
        if not chunk_id:
            continue

        # 1. Add parent context (doc structure hierarchy)
        parent_id = chunk.get("metadata", {}).get("parent_id")
        if parent_id and parent_id in chunk_map:
            enhanced_results.add(chunk_map[parent_id])

        # 2. Add sequential context (previous/next chunks)
        sequence_position = chunk.get("metadata", {}).get("sequence_position")
        section = chunk.get("metadata", {}).get("section")
        if sequence_position and section:
            # Find adjacent chunks in same section
            for adj_chunk in chunk_map.values():
                adj_section = adj_chunk.get("metadata", {}).get("section")
                adj_position = adj_chunk.get("metadata", {}).get("sequence_position")
                if (adj_section == section and
                    abs(adj_position - sequence_position) <= traversal_depth):
                    enhanced_results.add(adj_chunk)

        # 3. Add usage examples for API components
        if chunk.get("metadata", {}).get("is_api_definition"):
            # Find chunks that reference this API
            for potential_usage in chunk_map.values():
                if chunk_id in potential_usage.get("metadata", {}).get("references", []):
                    enhanced_results.add(potential_usage)

        # 4. Add implementation examples for concepts
        if chunk.get("metadata", {}).get("is_concept"):
            # Find related implementation examples
            for impl_chunk in chunk_map.values():
                if (impl_chunk.get("metadata", {}).get("implements_concept") == chunk_id or
                    impl_chunk.get("metadata", {}).get("is_code_example") and
                    chunk_id in impl_chunk.get("metadata", {}).get("related_concepts", [])):
                    enhanced_results.add(impl_chunk)

    return list(enhanced_results)
```

### 3. Query-Type Aware Traversal

Different types of developer questions benefit from different relationship traversals:

- **"How to" questions**: Prioritize examples, sequential steps, and implementations
- **"What is" questions**: Prioritize concept explanations and parent context
- **"Why" questions**: Prioritize explanations that connect concepts
- **Error-related questions**: Prioritize error-solution pairs and diagnostic information

## Applications to Aptos/Move Documentation

For Aptos and Move specifically, these relationship types are particularly valuable:

### 1. Move Module Hierarchies

- Connect module definitions with their resources and functions
- Link standard library modules with custom implementations

### 2. Transaction Flow Context

- Connect transaction builder code with on-chain function implementations
- Link error handling with potential transaction failures

### 3. Capability Dependencies

- Connect resources with their required abilities (copy, drop, store, key)
- Link type constraints with their implications for contract design

### 4. Smart Contract Patterns

- Connect design patterns with their implementations
- Link common vulnerabilities with secure implementations

## Integration with Multi-Step RAG

Graph-based chunking can significantly enhance multi-step RAG by:

1. Reducing the need for follow-up queries by including relevant context upfront
2. Providing more targeted context for generating follow-up queries
3. Allowing for "graph-walking" instead of semantic search for certain follow-ups

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Enhance Preprocessing**: Modify the chunk creation pipeline to extract and store relationship metadata
2. **Build Relationship Index**: Create efficient indices for traversing relationships during retrieval
3. **Implement Adaptive Traversal**: Adjust traversal strategy based on query type and initial results
4. **Measure Impact**: Compare performance with and without graph-based expansion

## Performance Considerations

Graph traversal can be computationally expensive. To optimize:

1. **Pre-compute common traversals**: Cache frequently accessed relationships
2. **Limit traversal depth**: Start with immediate relationships (depth=1)
3. **Prioritize high-value relationships**: Not all relationships are equally valuable
4. **Use efficient graph data structures**: Consider specialized graph databases for large documentation sets

_This approach represents a significant enhancement over purely semantic retrieval systems and is particularly well-suited for complex technical documentation with strong hierarchical and referential relationships._
