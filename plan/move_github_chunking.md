# Chunking Strategy for Move Code Repositories

This document outlines a comprehensive approach to chunking and embedding Move language repositories for improved retrieval and synthesis in technical documentation systems.

## Multi-Level Chunking for Code

To effectively manage Move code repositories, implement a hierarchical chunking strategy:

1. **Repository-Level Chunking**
   - Store repo metadata (purpose, main modules, dependencies)
   - Track cross-repository references for ecosystem-wide relationships

2. **Package-Level Chunking**
   - Preserve Move.toml configurations as metadata
   - Track dependencies between packages

3. **Module-Level Chunking**
   - Each Move module as a primary chunk
   - Include imports, module structure, and resource definitions
   - Store structural metadata (resources, functions, constants)

4. **Function-Level Chunking**
   - Extract individual functions with signatures
   - Include neighboring functions that are commonly called together
   - Preserve parameter and return type relationships

5. **Code Block-Level Chunking**
   - For complex functions, extract logical code blocks
   - Identify patterns like initialization, validation, state changes

## LLM-Enhanced Preprocessing

Since Move is new to mainstream AI models, use LLM augmentation during preprocessing:

1. **Code Summarization**
   - For each module/function, generate natural language summaries
   - Include purpose, inputs/outputs, and side effects
   - Example: "This module manages coin transfers between accounts with balance validation"

2. **Code Translation**
   - Generate near-equivalent pseudocode in mainstream languages (Rust, TypeScript)
   - Create parallel embeddings of both Move code and translated versions
   - Example: "Move's resource-oriented ownership model translated to Rust-like borrowing"

3. **Concept Extraction**
   - Identify blockchain-specific concepts in code (resources, abilities, signer)
   - Link to explanatory documentation on those concepts
   - Example: "Uses `key` ability for global storage access"

4. **Usage Pattern Detection**
   - Generate examples of how to properly use each module/function
   - Identify common pitfalls or security considerations
   - Example: "This function must be called with a valid signer or it will abort"

## Relationship Graph Construction

Build explicit relationships between code entities:

1. **Call Graphs**
   - Track function calls between components
   - Identify entry points and common flows
   - Store directionality (caller → callee)

2. **Type Dependency Graphs**
   - Map relationships between types and their usage
   - Track resource abilities and constraints
   - Connect custom types to their implementations

3. **Module Interaction Maps**
   - Identify cross-module dependencies
   - Track which modules interact with which resources
   - Map framework dependencies for custom modules

4. **Error-Resolution Patterns**
   - Link common errors to resolution examples
   - Connect error codes to explanatory documentation
   - Map validation failures to required preconditions

5. **Test-to-Implementation Links**
   - Connect test cases to their implementation targets
   - Use tests as executable documentation
   - Extract test conditions as usage requirements

## Query-Optimized Chunking

Tailor chunks to common developer query patterns:

1. **"How to" Optimized Chunks**
   - Group code snippets that accomplish common tasks
   - Include initialization, execution, and cleanup steps
   - Example: "How to create a fungible asset in Move"

2. **"Debug" Optimized Chunks**
   - Include error messages, validation checks, and failure points
   - Group related validation logic
   - Example: "Common causes of E11: insufficient balance errors"

3. **"Conceptual" Optimized Chunks**
   - Link implementation to design principles
   - Include rationale comments and architectural decisions
   - Example: "How Move's object model differs from Ethereum's account model"

## Enhanced Metadata Structure

Extend your metadata schema to support code-specific relationships:

```json
{
  "id": "move_function_123",
  "content": "public fun transfer<CoinType>(from: &signer, to: address, amount: u64) { ... }",
  "summary": "Transfers coins from one account to another, checking balances",
  "pseudocode": "function transfer(sender, recipient, amount) { validateBalance(sender, amount); deductFrom(sender, amount); addTo(recipient, amount); }",
  "metadata": {
    "code_type": "function",
    "language": "move",
    "module": "aptos_framework::coin",
    "signature": "public fun transfer<CoinType>(from: &signer, to: address, amount: u64)",
    "generic_types": ["CoinType"],
    "parameters": [
      {"name": "from", "type": "&signer", "purpose": "Transaction signer"},
      {"name": "to", "type": "address", "purpose": "Recipient address"},
      {"name": "amount", "type": "u64", "purpose": "Amount to transfer"}
    ],
    "return_type": null,
    "abilities_required": ["key", "store"],
    "aborts_if": ["Insufficient balance", "Account does not exist"],
    "errors": ["E11", "E12"],
    "called_by": ["multi_agent_script_function_789", "coin_transfer_script_678"],
    "calls": ["balance_of_123", "withdraw_345", "deposit_456"],
    "related_tests": ["test_transfer_success_789", "test_transfer_insufficient_890"],
    "usage_examples": ["example_transfer_between_accounts_123"],
    "security_considerations": ["Should verify signer has sufficient balance"]
  }
}
```

## LLM-Assisted Query Understanding

Since Move is new, use LLMs to bridge the knowledge gap:

1. **Query Translation**
   - Translate user questions about Move into known concepts
   - Map user intentions to Move-specific patterns
   - Example: "How do I store data?" → "How do I use resources in Move?"

2. **Context Enhancement**
   - Analyze queries to detect implied Move concepts
   - Add missing context automatically
   - Example: "Using tables" → Add context about "Move storage model"

3. **Knowledge Synthesis**
   - Don't just retrieve code - synthesize understanding
   - Combine multiple code snippets into coherent explanations
   - Example: Combining struct definition, usage, and storage patterns

## Implementation Approach

1. **Static Analysis Pipeline**
   - Build a Move-aware parser for structural analysis
   - Extract imports, function calls, and type dependencies
   - Generate call graphs and dependency trees automatically

2. **Multi-Modal Embeddings**
   - Create separate embeddings for:
     - Raw Move code 
     - Natural language summaries
     - Pseudocode translations
     - Usage examples
   - Combine these for more robust retrieval

3. **Hybrid Retrieval System**
   - For Move-specific queries, prioritize structural matches over semantic
   - Use graph walks for related concept discovery
   - Implement "concept bridging" between documentation and code

4. **Dynamic Synthesis**
   - Instead of just retrieving chunks, synthesize responses from multiple sources
   - Use LLMs to "translate" Move concepts for beginners
   - Generate executable examples from retrieved patterns

## Code Example Specific Enhancements

For your code examples repositories:

1. **Pattern Libraries**
   - Categorize code examples by design pattern
   - Tag common implementation approaches
   - Provide "template" and "concrete implementation" versions

2. **Progressive Complexity**
   - Tag examples by complexity level
   - Chain related examples from simple to advanced
   - Create learning paths through code examples

3. **Cross-Referencing**
   - Link code examples to official documentation
   - Connect conceptual explanations to concrete implementations
   - Map tutorial steps to example repositories

4. **Incremental Examples**
   - Break complex implementations into step-by-step examples
   - Show evolution of code from simple to complete
   - Preserve "git history" as sequential learning context

## Evaluation and Optimization

1. **Developer Intent Testing**
   - Test retrieval against real developer questions
   - Measure "time to functional understanding"
   - Optimize for actual development workflows

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with basic structural relationships
   - Add more complex relationships as you validate their utility
   - Prioritize relationship types that most improve retrieval quality

3. **Feedback Loops**
   - Incorporate developer feedback on retrieval quality
   - Track which relationship types are most valuable in practice
   - Refine chunking strategy based on query patterns

## Final Considerations

1. **Onboarding New Developers**
   - Create special relationship types for "first-time concepts"
   - Build learning paths through the codebase
   - Connect conceptual documentation with practical examples

2. **Balancing Depth vs. Performance**
   - Not all relationships need to be traversed for every query
   - Use query intent to prioritize relationship types
   - Implement adaptive traversal depth based on query complexity

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Update chunks and relationships as code evolves
   - Preserve historical versions for backwards compatibility
   - Track breaking changes and their implications

## Integration with Documentation System

1. **Unified Knowledge Graph**
   - Connect code repositories with documentation chunks
   - Create seamless traversal between concepts and implementations
   - Build "implementsConceptFrom" and "explainedByDoc" relationships

2. **Multi-Repository Context**
   - Implement cross-repository awareness
   - Connect framework code with examples that use it
   - Build ecosystem-wide understanding of patterns

3. **Versioned Knowledge**
   - Track concept evolution across code versions
   - Maintain compatibility information
   - Support both "latest" and "specific version" queries
