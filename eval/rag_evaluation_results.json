      "question": "How do I create a dapp using Aptos and use the faucet API for funding accounts during development?",
      "ground_truth": "First, you need to set up your development environment. You need to have Node.js, npm, and Python 3.6+ installed as prerequisites. Then, use the `create-aptos-dapp` tool to generate a template project. This tool will save you time and help you avoid common setup errors, as it generates a predefined project structure, including a `contract` directory for your Move smart contract modules.\n\nAfter setting up your dapp, you will need to fund your test accounts with APT tokens for development and testing. The Aptos Faucet API can be used to get APT on the Aptos Devnet. The `create-aptos-dapp` tool has built-in commands that allow you to execute common tasks like this, but you can also send direct requests to the Faucet API's endpoint, which is \"https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com\" for Devnet.\n\nIf you are using the TypeScript SDK, for example, you can fund an account with the following command:\n\n```typescript\n// replace the account string with your account address\nconst account = \"0xd0f523c9e73e6f3d68c16ae883a9febc616e484c4998a72d8899a1009e5a89d6\";\n// replace '1' with the number of APT tokens to be funded\nconst amount = 1 * 100_000_000; // convert APT to Octas, as the amount used is in Octas (1 APT = 100,000,000 Octas)\nawait client.fundWithFaucet(account, amount);\n```\n\nNote that these tokens are solely for development purposes and have no real-world value.",

        }
      ],
      "ai_answer": "To create a decentralized application (dApp) on Aptos and use the Faucet API for funding accounts during development, follow these steps:\n---\n### 1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**\n   - Install the Aptos CLI by following the official guide: [Aptos CLI Installation](https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli/).\n   - Install the Aptos SDK for your preferred programming language (e.g., TypeScript, Python, etc.). Refer to the SDK documentation: [Aptos SDKs](https://aptos.dev/en/sdks/).\n---\n### 2. **Generate Accounts**\n   - Use the Aptos CLI to generate a new account:\n     ```bash\n     aptos init --profile <your-profile-name>\n     ```\n   - Alternatively, for more control, generate keys and accounts manually:\n     ```bash\n     aptos key generate --vanity-prefix 0x<your-prefix>\n     aptos account fund-with-faucet --account <your-newly-generated-account-address>\n     ```\n   - Note: On Devnet, the Faucet API is available to fund accounts with test `APT`. The endpoint for the Faucet API on Devnet is:\n     ```\n     https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com\n     ```\n---\n### 3. **Use the Faucet API for Funding Accounts**\n   - The Faucet API allows you to request test `APT` tokens for accounts during development. You can use it in your dApp backend or scripts by making a POST request to the API.\n   - Example request using `curl`:\n     ```bash\n     curl -X POST https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com/mint \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d '{\n       \"address\": \"0x<your-account-address>\",\n       \"amount\": 1000000\n     }'\n     ```\n   - Replace `0x<your-account-address>` with your account address and `amount` with the desired token amount in micro `APT` (1 APT = 1,000,000 micro APT).\n   - Example response:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"transaction_hash\": \"0xabc123...\",\n       \"success\": true\n     }\n     ```\n---\n### 4. **Integrate Funding Logic in Your dApp**\n   - In your dApp, you can integrate the Faucet API for funding new accounts programmatically. For example, using JavaScript with `fetch`:\n     ```javascript\n     async function fundAccount(address, amount) {\n       const response = await fetch('https://faucet.devnet.aptoslabs.com/mint', {\n         method: 'POST',\n         headers: {\n           'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n         },\n         body: JSON.stringify({\n           address: address,\n           amount: amount,\n         }),\n       });\n       const result = await response.json();\n       console.log('Faucet response:', result);\n       return result;\n     }\n     // Example usage\n     const address = '0x<your-account-address>';\n     const amount = 1000000; // 1 APT\n     fundAccount(address, amount).then(console.log);\n     ```\n---\n### 5. **Deploy and Test Your dApp**\n   - Deploy your Move smart contracts to the Aptos Devnet for testing.\n   - Use the funded accounts to interact with your dApp and test its functionality.\n   - You can view account information and transactions on the [Aptos Explorer](https://explorer.devnet.aptos.dev).\n---\n### 6. **Transition to Testnet or Mainnet**\n   - On Testnet, you can mint `APT` using the [Testnet Mint Page](https://aptos.dev/en/network/faucet).\n   - On Mainnet, the Faucet API is not available, and you will need to fund accounts with actual `APT`.\n---\nFor further discussions or questions about creating a dApp or using the Faucet API, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

      "ai_answer": "To check if a connected account has a `TodoList` resource and display different elements in your React application based on this, you can use the Aptos TypeScript SDK as follows:\n### Steps to Implement:\n1. **Install the Aptos TypeScript SDK**  \n   In your project directory, install the SDK by running:\n   ```bash\n   npm i @aptos-labs/ts-sdk\n   ```\n2. **Import the Required Modules**  \n   In your `App.tsx` file, import the `Aptos` class and other necessary modules:\n   ```typescript\n   import { Aptos } from \"@aptos-labs/ts-sdk\";\n   import { useWallet } from \"@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react\";\n   import { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\n   import { Layout, Row, Col, Button } from \"antd\";\n   ```\n3. **Initialize the Aptos Instance**  \n   Create an instance of the `Aptos` class to interact with the Aptos chain:\n   ```typescript\n   const aptos = new Aptos();\n   ```\n4. **Set Up State Variables**  \n   Add local state variables to track whether the connected account has a `TodoList` resource:\n   ```typescript\n   const [accountHasList, setAccountHasList] = useState<boolean>(false);\n   ```\n5. **Fetch the `TodoList` Resource**  \n   Define a function called `fetchList` to check if the connected account has the `TodoList` resource:\n   ```typescript\n   const fetchList = async () => {\n     if (!account) return [];\n     \n     // Replace with your module account address\n     const moduleAddress = \"0xcbddf398841353776903dbab2fdaefc54f181d07e114ae818b1a67af28d1b018\";\n     try {\n       const todoListResource = await aptos.getAccountResource({\n         accountAddress: account?.address,\n         resourceType: `${moduleAddress}::todolist::TodoList`,\n       });\n       setAccountHasList(true);\n     } catch (e: any) {\n       setAccountHasList(false);\n     }\n   };\n   ```\n   - `account?.address`: The connected account's address obtained from the wallet.\n   - `resourceType`: Specifies the Move resource type for the `TodoList`.\n6. **Use `useEffect` to React to Account Changes**  \n   Add a `useEffect` hook to call the `fetchList` function whenever the connected account changes:\n   ```typescript\n   useEffect(() => {\n     fetchList();\n   }, [account?.address]);\n   ```\n7. **Display Conditional UI**  \n   Update your UI to display different elements based on the presence of the `TodoList` resource:\n   ```typescript\n   return (\n     <>\n       <Layout>\n         <Row align=\"middle\">\n           <Col span={10} offset={2}>\n             <h1>Our TodoList</h1>\n           </Col>\n           <Col span={12} style={{ textAlign: \"right\", paddingRight: \"200px\" }}>\n             <WalletSelector />\n           </Col>\n         </Row>\n       </Layout>\n       {!accountHasList ? (\n         <Row gutter={[0, 32]} style={{ marginTop: \"2rem\" }}>\n           <Col span={8} offset={8}>\n             <Button\n               block\n               type=\"primary\"\n               style={{ height: \"40px\", backgroundColor: \"#3f67ff\" }}\n             >\n               Add new list\n             </Button>\n           </Col>\n         </Row>\n       ) : (\n         <Row gutter={[0, 32]} style={{ marginTop: \"2rem\" }}>\n           <Col span={8} offset={8}>\n             <p>Your TodoList is loaded!</p>\n           </Col>\n         </Row>\n       )}\n     </>\n   );\n   ```\n   - If `accountHasList` is `false`, display an \"Add new list\" button.\n   - If `accountHasList` is `true`, show a placeholder message or the actual `TodoList` data (to be implemented later).\n### Explanation:\n- The `fetchList` function checks if the connected account has a `TodoList` resource by querying the Aptos blockchain using the `getAccountResource` method from the SDK.\n- The `useEffect` hook ensures the `fetchList` function is triggered whenever the connected account changes.\n- The UI dynamically updates based on the `accountHasList` state.\nFor further discussions or questions about account, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

Here are the steps to achieve integration:\n### Steps to Integrate an Aptos Wallet with Your dApp\n1. **Install the Wallet Adapter Package**:\n   Use the `aptos-wallet-adapter` package to connect your dApp to supported wallets. Install the package via npm:\n   ```bash\n   npm install aptos-wallet-adapter\n   ```\n2. **Initialize the Wallet Adapter**:\n   In your dApp, initialize the `WalletAdapter` to manage wallet connections. This allows you to connect to any wallet that supports the Aptos Wallet Adapter interface.\n3. **Update the Wallet Adapter Version**:\n   As new wallets integrate with the Wallet Adapter, ensure you update your `aptos-wallet-adapter` package to support these wallets without additional changes.\n4. **Implement Wallet Connection Logic**:\n   Use the Wallet Adapter's API to connect to the desired wallet, sign transactions, and interact with the Aptos blockchain.\n   Example of connecting to a wallet:\n   ```typescript\n   import { WalletAdapter } from 'aptos-wallet-adapter';\n   const walletAdapter = new WalletAdapter();\n   async function connectWallet() {\n       await walletAdapter.connect();\n       console.log(\"Connected wallet address:\", walletAdapter.publicAccount);\n   }\n   connectWallet();\n   ```\n5. **Test with Multiple Wallets**:\n   The Wallet Adapter supports an ever-growing list of wallets. By integrating the adapter, your dApp can automatically support these wallets without additional configuration.\n### Benefits of Using the Wallet Adapter\n- **Unified Interface**: One integration supports multiple wallets.\n- **Future-Proof**: As new wallets adopt the Wallet Adapter standard, your dApp can connect to them by simply updating the adapter package.\n- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies wallet management for both dApp developers and users.\nFor wallet providers, integrating with the Wallet Adapter ensures compatibility with a wide range of Aptos dApps.\nFor more details on the Wallet Adapter, refer to the official documentation: [Wallet Adapter](https://aptos.dev/en/build/sdks/wallet-adapter).\nFor further discussions or questions about aptos, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

      "ai_answer": "To set up a validator node, stake the necessary coins, and interact with your node using the Aptos Fullnode API, follow these steps:\n---\n### 1. Deploy and Configure Your Validator Node\nBefore setting up a validator node, ensure you meet the node requirements. You can find these requirements here: [Node Requirements](https://aptos.dev/en/network/nodes/validator-node/node-requirements).\n- Select a deployment method for your validator node and validator fullnode (VFN). Refer to the deployment guides for step-by-step instructions: [Deploy Nodes](https://aptos.dev/en/network/nodes/validator-node).\n- Once your nodes are deployed, you need to connect them to an Aptos network. This involves initializing your staking pool and joining the validator set. See the guide here: [Connect Nodes](https://aptos.dev/en/network/nodes/validator-node/connect-nodes).\n---\n### 2. Stake the Necessary Coins\nTo participate as a validator, you must meet the minimum staking requirements. As of now, the minimum stake required is **1 Million APT tokens**. The staking process involves:\n1. Configuring the on-chain validator network addresses and rotating the consensus key.\n2. Depositing the required Aptos coins into your staking pool. You can either:\n   - Stake your own coins.\n   - Have funds assigned by a staking service.\n**Important Notes:**\n- Your validator node cannot sync until the stake pool becomes active.\n- The staked pool will be locked up for a fixed duration set by Aptos governance and will automatically renew upon expiration. You cannot withdraw your staked amount until the lockup period ends. See more details in the [Aptos staking module](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/00a234cc233b01f1a7e1680f81b72214a7af91a9/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/stake.move#L728).\nFor detailed steps to join the validator set, refer to this guide: [Joining Validator Set](https://aptos.dev/en/network/nodes/validator-node/connect-nodes/connect-to-aptos-network#join-the-validator-set).\n---\n### 3. Wait for Activation\nAfter staking the required amount:\n- Your validator node will become active only after the new epoch starts.\n- Once active, your validator will participate in consensus and earn rewards.\n---\n### 4. Interact with Your Validator Fullnode Using the Aptos Fullnode API\nOnce your validator fullnode (VFN) is fully operational, you can interact with it using the Aptos Fullnode API. The API allows you to query blockchain data, submit transactions, and monitor your validator node. Here\u2019s an example of how to interact with your node:\n#### Example: Query the Account State\nYou can use the `/accounts/{address}` endpoint to fetch the state of an account.\n```bash\ncurl http://<your-fullnode-IP>:8080/v1/accounts/<account-address>\n```\nReplace `<your-fullnode-IP>` with your VFN\u2019s IP address and `<account-address>` with the desired account address.\n#### Example: Submit a Transaction\nTo submit a transaction, use the `/transactions` endpoint. Here\u2019s an example of a request payload:\n```json\n{\n  \"sender\": \"0x<sender-address>\",\n  \"sequence_number\": \"0\",\n  \"max_gas_amount\": \"1000\",\n  \"gas_unit_price\": \"1\",\n  \"expiration_timestamp_secs\": \"1672531200\",\n  \"payload\": {\n    \"type\": \"script_function_payload\",\n    \"function\": \"0x1::coin::transfer\",\n    \"type_arguments\": [\"0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin\"],\n    \"arguments\": [\"0x<recipient-address>\", \"1000000\"]\n  }\n}\n```\nSubmit the above payload using a POST request:\n```bash\ncurl -X POST http://<your-fullnode-IP>:8080/v1/transactions \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-d @transaction.json\n```\n---\n### Additional Notes\n- Always ensure your validator and VFN are running on secure infrastructure.\n- Monitor your validator node for uptime and performance to avoid penalties.\n- Refer to the full API documentation for more endpoints and details: [Aptos Fullnode API](https://aptos.dev/en/build/fullnode-api).\n---\nFor further discussions or questions about validator, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

      "ai_answer": "You can use the Aptos Indexer API to query historical data and aggregate data about transactions and tokens on the Aptos blockchain. The Indexer API provides a GraphQL interface to access indexed data, making it easier to retrieve complex or large-scale blockchain data.\n### Steps to Query Historical and Aggregate Data\n1. **Access Historical Data**  \n   Historical data includes information about past transactions, account activities, and other blockchain events. For example, you can query all transactions submitted by a specific account.\n   Example Query:\n   ```graphql\n   query GetAccountTransactions($address: String, $offset: Int) {\n     transactions(\n       where: {sender: {_eq: $address}},\n       offset: $offset,\n       limit: 100,\n       order_by: {timestamp: desc}\n     ) {\n       hash\n       sender\n       payload\n       timestamp\n       __typename\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   Example Variables:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"address\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\",\n     \"offset\": 0\n   }\n   ```\n2. **Query Aggregate Data**  \n   Aggregate data includes summaries or counts of blockchain entities, such as the total number of NFTs or fungible tokens.\n   Example Query to Get Fungible Asset Balances:\n   ```graphql\n   query GetFungibleAssetBalances($address: String, $offset: Int) {\n     current_fungible_asset_balances(\n       where: {owner_address: {_eq: $address}},\n       offset: $offset,\n       limit: 100,\n       order_by: {amount: desc}\n     ) {\n       asset_type\n       amount\n       __typename\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   Example Variables:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"address\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\",\n     \"offset\": 0\n   }\n   ```\n3. **Use the Free Hosted Version of the Indexer API**  \n   Aptos Labs provides a free hosted version of the Indexer API that you can use to query this data. The API supports querying data such as:\n   - **Historical Data**: What transactions have impacted an account?\n   - **Aggregate Data**: How many delegators are in a staking pool or how many NFTs exist?\n4. **Leverage the GraphQL API**  \n   The Indexer API exposes all indexed data through a GraphQL interface. This allows you to perform complex queries efficiently, such as retrieving all NFTs owned by an account or identifying token ownership.\n   Example Query to Retrieve NFTs Owned by an Account:\n   ```graphql\n   query GetNFTs($address: String) {\n     current_token_ownerships(\n       where: {owner_address: {_eq: $address}},\n       limit: 100\n     ) {\n       token_data_id\n       property_version\n       amount\n       __typename\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n5. **Explore the Documentation**  \n   For more details on specific queries, you can refer to the official documentation pages, such as:\n   - [Account Transactions](https://aptos.dev/en/build/indexer/account-transactions)\n   - [Get Delegators](https://aptos.dev/en/build/indexer/get-delegators)\n   - [Get NFTs](https://aptos.dev/en/build/indexer/get-nfts)\n### Key Features of the Indexer API\n- Tracks every transaction on-chain and indexes data like fungible assets, tokens, collections, accounts, and more.\n- Provides advanced queries that are difficult to achieve with the simpler [Aptos Node API](https://aptos.dev/en/apis/fullnode-rest-api).\n- Offers historical and aggregate data for a variety of use cases.\nFor further discussions or questions about transactions, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

      ],
      "ai_answer": "To mint your own coin on the Aptos blockchain using the Python SDK, you need to follow these steps:\n### 1. Define and Deploy Your Coin\nBefore minting, you must define and deploy your custom coin module on the Aptos blockchain. The `MoonCoin` example can be used as a reference. The coin module should include the necessary Move code to define your coin's properties (e.g., name, symbol, decimals) and its minting functionality.\nRefer to the Aptos Move framework's [coin.move](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/coin.move) for details.\n### 2. Set Up the Python SDK\nInstall the Aptos Python SDK in your environment:\n```bash\npip install aptos-sdk\n```\n### 3. Initialize the Python SDK and Create a Client\nSet up the Aptos SDK to interact with the blockchain:\n```python\nfrom aptos_sdk.client import RestClient\nfrom aptos_sdk.account import Account\n# Initialize the client\nnode_url = \"https://fullnode.devnet.aptoslabs.com\"  # Use the appropriate network URL\nclient = RestClient(node_url)\n# Create or load your account\ncreator_account = Account.generate()  # Or load an existing account\n```\n### 4. Deploy the Coin Module\nUse the SDK to publish your Move module (e.g., `MoonCoin.move`) to the blockchain. This step requires compiling your Move code into a `.mv` bytecode file and submitting it as a transaction.\n```python\n# Assuming you have compiled the Move module into bytecode\nwith open(\"MoonCoin.mv\", \"rb\") as f:\n    bytecode = f.read()\n# Submit the transaction to deploy the module\ntxn_hash = client.publish_module(creator_account, bytecode)\nprint(f\"Transaction hash for module publishing: {txn_hash}\")\n```\n### 5. Initialize and Mint the Coin\nAfter deploying the module, initialize and mint your coin. This involves invoking the initialization and minting functions defined in your Move module.\n#### Initialize the Coin:\n```python\nfrom aptos_sdk.transactions import EntryFunction\n# Define the initialization transaction\ninitialize_txn = EntryFunction.natural(\n    module=\"creator_address::MoonCoin\",  # Replace with your module's address and name\n    function=\"initialize\",\n    ty_args=[],\n    args=[\"MoonCoin\", \"MOON\", 6]  # Replace with your coin's name, symbol, and decimals\n)\n# Submit the initialization transaction\ntxn_hash = client.submit_transaction(creator_account, initialize_txn)\nprint(f\"Transaction hash for initialization: {txn_hash}\")\n```\n#### Mint the Coin:\n```python\n# Mint coins to a recipient\nrecipient_address = \"0xRecipientAddress\"  # Replace with the recipient's address\namount_to_mint = 1000\nmint_txn = EntryFunction.natural(\n    module=\"creator_address::MoonCoin\",  # Replace with your module's address and name\n    function=\"mint\",\n    ty_args=[],\n    args=[recipient_address, amount_to_mint]\n)\n# Submit the mint transaction\ntxn_hash = client.submit_transaction(creator_account, mint_txn)\nprint(f\"Transaction hash for minting: {txn_hash}\")\n```\n### 6. Integrate the Minting Process into Your Application\nTo integrate this process into your application:\n1. **Setup Backend Logic**:\n   - Use the Python SDK to handle the coin initialization and minting logic.\n   - Store the creator account's private key securely for signing transactions.\n2. **Frontend Interaction**:\n   - Allow users to request minted coins by providing their wallet address.\n   - Use an API endpoint to trigger the minting function in your backend.\n3. **Transaction Monitoring**:\n   - Implement transaction monitoring in your application to provide real-time feedback on the status of minting.\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - Handle errors such as insufficient gas, invalid recipient addresses, or unauthorized minting attempts.\n5. **Testing**:\n   - Test the integration on the Aptos testnet or devnet before deploying it to mainnet.\nFor further discussions or questions about blockchain, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

      "ai_answer": "To integrate the Aptos blockchain into your platform and create transactions for a new coin minted using the TypeScript SDK, you can follow these steps:\n---\n### 1. Prepare an Environment for Testing\nSet up your environment to work with the Aptos blockchain. This includes installing the necessary tools and dependencies. For the TypeScript SDK, you can install it via npm:\n```bash\nnpm install aptos\n```\nYou may also need Node.js installed on your machine.\n---\n### 2. Create an Account on the Blockchain\nAn account is required to interact with the Aptos blockchain. Accounts are used to pay gas fees and to own resources like coins. Use the TypeScript SDK to create an account:\n```typescript\nimport { AptosAccount } from \"aptos\";\n// Create a new account\nconst account = new AptosAccount();\nconsole.log(\"Address:\", account.address().hex());\nconsole.log(\"Private Key:\", account.toPrivateKeyObject());\n```\nFund the account with APT tokens using a faucet if you're on a testnet.\n---\n### 3. Mint a New Coin\nTo mint a new coin, you need to publish a Move module that defines the coin. Use the Aptos CLI or Aptos SDK to compile and publish your module. For example, your Move module might look like this:\n```move\nmodule MyCoin {\n    public fun mint() { /* Minting logic */ }\n    public fun transfer() { /* Transfer logic */ }\n}\n```\nAfter publishing the module, you can interact with it using the TypeScript SDK.\n---\n### 4. Exchange Account Identifiers\nIf your platform involves multiple entities (e.g., users), exchange account addresses to enable transactions between accounts. The `account.address().hex()` method provides the unique identifier of an account.\n---\n### 5. Create a Transaction\nCreate a transaction to interact with the blockchain. For example, to call the `mint` function from your Move module:\n```typescript\nimport { AptosClient, TxnBuilderTypes, BCS } from \"aptos\";\nconst client = new AptosClient(\"https://fullnode.devnet.aptoslabs.com\");\n// Define transaction payload\nconst payload = {\n  type: \"entry_function_payload\",\n  function: \"0xYourModuleAddress::MyCoin::mint\",\n  arguments: [/* arguments for the function */],\n  type_arguments: [],\n};\n// Submit the transaction\nconst txnRequest = await client.generateTransaction(account.address(), payload);\nconst signedTxn = await client.signTransaction(account, txnRequest);\nconst transactionResponse = await client.submitTransaction(signedTxn);\nconsole.log(\"Transaction Hash:\", transactionResponse.hash);\n```\n---\n### 6. Obtain a Gas Estimate and Validate the Transaction\nBefore submitting a transaction, you can estimate the gas fee and validate the transaction for correctness:\n```typescript\nconst gasEstimate = await client.estimateGasPrice();\nconsole.log(\"Gas Estimate:\", gasEstimate);\n```\n---\n### 7. Submit the Transaction to the Blockchain\nOnce the transaction is prepared and validated, submit it to the blockchain as shown in step 5.\n---\n### 8. Wait for the Outcome of the Transaction\nWait for the transaction to be processed and confirm its success or failure:\n```typescript\nconst txnResult = await client.waitForTransaction(transactionResponse.hash);\nconsole.log(\"Transaction Status:\", txnResult.success);\n```\n---\n### 9. Query Historical Transactions\nYou can query historical transactions for an account to track interactions, such as deposits and withdrawals:\n```typescript\nconst transactions = await client.getAccountTransactions(account.address());\nconsole.log(\"Transactions:\", transactions);\n```\n---\nFor more details on using the TypeScript SDK, you can refer to the official documentation: [Aptos TypeScript SDK](https://aptos.dev/en/sdks/ts-sdk).\nFor further discussions or questions about transactions, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

      "ai_answer": "To create a lottery system on Aptos using the randomness API and storing the lottery entries in a `SmartVector`, you can follow these steps. The `SmartVector` provides a more advanced and scalable way to manage dynamic collections of data, such as player addresses in a lottery.\nHere\u2019s an example implementation in Move:\n```move\nmodule module_owner::lottery_with_smartvector {\n    use aptos_framework::randomness;\n    use aptos_framework::smart_vector;\n    struct LotteryState has key {\n        players: smart_vector::SmartVector<address>,\n        winner_idx: std::option::Option<u64>,\n    }\n    fun initialize_lottery(account: &signer) {\n        let players = smart_vector::create<address>(account);\n        let state = LotteryState {\n            players,\n            winner_idx: std::option::none(),\n        };\n        move_to(account, state);\n    }\n    fun load_lottery_state_mut(account: &signer): &mut LotteryState {\n        borrow_global_mut<LotteryState>(signer::address_of(account))\n    }\n    #[randomness]\n    entry fun decide_winner(account: &signer) {\n        let lottery_state = load_lottery_state_mut(account);\n        let n = smart_vector::length(&lottery_state.players);\n        assert!(n > 0, 1); // Ensure there are players in the lottery\n        let winner_idx = randomness::u64_range(0, n);\n        lottery_state.winner_idx = std::option::some(winner_idx);\n    }\n    entry fun add_player(account: &signer, player: address) {\n        let lottery_state = load_lottery_state_mut(account);\n        smart_vector::push(&mut lottery_state.players, player);\n    }\n    public fun get_winner(account: &signer): address {\n        let lottery_state = borrow_global<LotteryState>(signer::address_of(account));\n        let winner_idx = std::option::borrow(&lottery_state.winner_idx);\n        assert!(winner_idx.is_some(), 2); // Ensure a winner has been decided\n        smart_vector::borrow(&lottery_state.players, *winner_idx)\n    }\n}\n```\n### Explanation of the Code\n1. **Lottery State**:\n   - The `LotteryState` struct stores the list of players in a `SmartVector<address>` and the index of the winner as an optional `u64`.\n2. **Initialization**:\n   - The `initialize_lottery` function sets up the `SmartVector` for the players and initializes the `LotteryState` in the account.\n3. **Adding Players**:\n   - The `add_player` function allows adding a player's address to the `SmartVector`. This ensures dynamic and efficient handling of entries.\n4. **Deciding the Winner**:\n   - The `decide_winner` function uses the Aptos randomness API. The `randomness::u64_range(0, n)` call generates a random index in the range `[0, n)`. The `#[randomness]` attribute ensures the randomness API is enabled at runtime.\n5. **Fetching the Winner**:\n   - The `get_winner` function retrieves the winner's address from the `SmartVector` using the stored winner index.\n6. **Assertions**:\n   - The code includes assertions to ensure the lottery state is valid (e.g., there are players in the lottery, a winner has been decided).\n### Why Use `SmartVector`?\n- **Efficiency**: `SmartVector` is optimized for dynamic collections, making it ideal for handling player lists that grow or shrink.\n- **Scalability**: It is designed to handle large datasets efficiently, which is useful for lotteries with many participants.\n- **Flexibility**: Provides advanced operations and ensures data integrity.\nFor more details on `SmartVector`, refer to the documentation: [SmartVector Guide](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts).\nFor further discussions or questions about aptos, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

The `Object<Metadata>` contains details about the fungible asset, while the `Object<FungibleStore>` stores a count of fungible asset units owned by an account. \n\nOne common security concern is ensuring that only the rightful owners can access these objects. This can be achieved by implementing ownership checks. In the Move language, every `Object<T>` can be accessed by anyone, which means any `Object<T>` can be passed to any function, even if the caller doesn't own it. You should verify that the signer is the rightful owner of the object.\n\nFor example, you can include a function in your contract that takes in an `&signer` and an `Object<T>` as parameters, and checks if the signer is the owner of the object. If not, the function should halt execution and return an error.",

        }
      ],
      "ai_answer": "To ensure that your Fungible Assets implemented in Move are secure and only accessible to rightful owners, you should leverage the following features of the Move programming language and the Aptos framework:\n1. **Resource Scarcity**:\n   - In Move, assets are represented as `resources`. Resources enforce scarcity by preventing duplication or accidental deletion. Structs that represent resources cannot be copied or dropped unless explicitly defined with `copy` or `drop` capabilities.\n   - This ensures that your fungible assets cannot be unintentionally duplicated or destroyed, preserving their integrity.\n2. **Access Control through Modules**:\n   - Use module access privileges to control how your assets are created, stored, and transferred. In Move:\n     - Only public module functions can be accessed by other modules.\n     - Structs without a public constructor can only be created within the module that defines them.\n     - Fields within structs are private by default and can only be accessed or modified within the defining module or via explicitly defined public accessor and setter functions.\n   Example:\n   ```move\n   module MyFungibleAsset {\n       struct Asset has key, store {\n           amount: u64,\n       }\n       public fun create_asset(amount: u64): Asset {\n           assert!(amount > 0, 1); // Ensure valid amount\n           Asset { amount }\n       }\n       public fun get_amount(asset: &Asset): u64 {\n           asset.amount\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n3. **Signer Verification**:\n   - Transactions in Move are tied to a `signer`, which represents the verified owner of an account. Only the `signer` can add or modify resources in their account.\n   - You can require a `signer` parameter in your module functions to ensure that only authorized accounts can perform sensitive actions like transferring or modifying fungible assets.\n   Example:\n   ```move\n   public fun transfer_asset(sender: &signer, receiver: address, asset: Asset) {\n       assert!(is_account_exists(receiver), 2); // Ensure receiver exists\n       move_to(&receiver, asset); // Transfer asset to receiver\n   }\n   ```\n4. **Multisig Accounts for Enhanced Security**:\n   - Use the Aptos framework's multisig account feature to add an additional layer of security. Multisig accounts require multiple parties to approve critical transactions, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions.\n   - This is particularly useful for managing high-value fungible assets or assets in shared accounts.\n   For more details on creating and managing fungible assets with multisig accounts, refer to the guide: [Manage Fungible Assets with Multisig](https://aptos.dev/en/build/guides).\n5. **Global Storage Control**:\n   - Structs defined with the `key` ability can only be stored in global storage within the module that defines them. This ensures that assets are stored and managed securely within the intended module.\nBy combining these features\u2014resource scarcity, module access control, signer verification, multisig accounts, and storage control\u2014you can ensure that your fungible assets are secure and only accessible to the rightful owners.\nFor further discussions or questions about Move, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

      "ai_answer": "To create a fungible asset (FA) on the Aptos blockchain that can represent real-world assets, you can use the **Aptos Fungible Asset Standard**. This standard provides a type-safe and flexible framework for creating and managing fungible assets, such as currencies, shares, or other interchangeable resources.\n### Steps to Create a Fungible Asset:\n1. **Understand the Aptos Fungible Asset Standard**  \n   The **Aptos Fungible Asset Standard** improves upon the previous `aptos_framework::coin` module by addressing its limitations, such as lack of enforcement for freeze and burn functionalities. It also introduces advanced features like programmable transfers (e.g., approvals similar to ERC-20).\n   You can review the standard's implementation in the Move module here: [Aptos Fungible Asset Standard](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework/sources/fungible_asset.move).\n2. **Define Your Asset**  \n   Use the `fungible_asset` module to define the properties of your fungible asset. This includes:\n   - Asset name\n   - Asset symbol\n   - Decimals (precision)\n   - Total supply\n   - Metadata (to link real-world asset details)\n3. **Write a Smart Contract**  \n   In Aptos, you write smart contracts using the Move language. Below is an example of how you might define and initialize a fungible asset:\n   ```move\n   module MyAsset {\n       use aptos_framework::fungible_asset;\n       public fun initialize_asset(account: &signer) {\n           let asset = fungible_asset::create(\n               account,\n               name: b\"MyRealWorldAsset\", // Asset name\n               symbol: b\"RWA\",           // Asset symbol\n               decimals: 2,              // Precision\n               total_supply: 1_000_000,  // Total supply\n           );\n           // Additional logic, e.g., linking metadata\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n4. **Deploy the Smart Contract**  \n   Deploy the Move module containing your fungible asset logic to the Aptos blockchain using the Aptos CLI or an SDK (e.g., TypeScript or Python SDK).\n5. **Interact with Your Asset**  \n   After deployment, you can:\n   - Mint new tokens\n   - Transfer tokens between accounts\n   - Freeze or burn tokens (if supported by your implementation)\n   - Query asset metadata to link it to real-world details\n6. **Follow Asset Standards**  \n   Ensure you adhere to the Aptos asset standards for fungible assets. This will help maintain compatibility and ensure your asset can be used across different applications in the ecosystem. Refer to the official documentation for asset standards: [Aptos Asset Standards](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts/aptos-standards/#asset-standards).\n### Example Use Case: Representing Real-World Assets\nIf you want your fungible asset to represent a real-world asset (e.g., gold, real estate shares, or carbon credits), you can include metadata in your asset implementation. This metadata can contain details like:\n- Asset description\n- Regulatory information\n- Links to external documentation or proofs\nFor example:\n```move\nlet metadata = fungible_asset::create_metadata(\n    description: b\"Gold-backed token\",\n    external_url: b\"https://example.com/gold-backed-token\",\n    properties: map {\n        b\"issuer\" => b\"GoldTrust Inc.\",\n        b\"weight\" => b\"1 gram\",\n    }\n);\n```\nThis metadata can be queried by users to verify the real-world asset backing.\n---\nFor further discussions or questions about blockchain, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

      "ai_answer": "To efficiently filter data when querying the Indexer API, you should leverage the available indexes for each table. Here are the key points to consider:\n1. **Use Indexed Columns**: Queries perform best when they utilize indexed columns. Indexed columns are specifically optimized for fast lookups and filtering.\n2. **Composite B-tree Indexes**: Some indexes in the Indexer API are composite B-tree indexes, which consist of multiple columns. These indexes are ordered and perform optimally when your query uses a left-most prefix of the indexed columns.\n3. **`where` Clauses**: Structure your `where` clauses to align with the indexed columns. This ensures that the database can quickly filter the data using the indexes rather than performing a full table scan.\n   For example, if a table has a composite index on `(column1, column2)`, filtering by `column1` or both `column1` and `column2` will be efficient, but filtering by only `column2` may not leverage the index effectively.\nFor detailed information about the indexed columns and their structure, you can refer to the documentation: https://aptos.dev/en/build/indexer/indexer-api.\nFor further discussions or questions about the Indexer API, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

      "ground_truth": "To read the events emitted by your Move smart contract while testing on the Aptos Testnet, you would typically take the following steps:\n\n1. Write your Move smart contract. While doing so, define your module events using the `#[event]` attribute for any struct that has `drop` and `store` abilities. \n\n2. Deploy your smart contract to the Aptos Testnet. You can use the Testnet Faucet to acquire test tokens if required.\n\n3. Execute your smart contract and trigger the events you need to read. \n\n4. Query the module events using the GraphQL API. You can find example module events and their indices on the Aptos explorer.\n\nRemember that events are stored in a separate merkle tree (event accumulator) for each transaction. However, they are ephemeral and independent of the state tree, so the MoveVM does not have read access to events when executing a transaction in production.",

      ],
      "ai_answer": "To read the events emitted during the execution of your Move smart contract on the Aptos Testnet, you need to understand how events are defined and accessed in the Aptos blockchain. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n### 1. Understand Events in Move\nMove smart contracts can define their own events and emit them during execution. Aptos supports two types of events:\n- **Module events**: These are the modern and recommended event mechanism introduced in framework release 1.7.\n- **EventHandle events**: These are deprecated but still present for backward compatibility.\nEvents are stored on-chain and can be queried by their associated `EventHandle`.\n### 2. Emit Events in Your Move Module\nIn your Move module, ensure you define and emit events. For example:\n```move\nmodule MyModule {\n    use std::event;\n    struct MyEvent has drop, store {\n        message: vector<u8>,\n    }\n    public fun emit_event(account: &signer, message: vector<u8>) {\n        let event_handle = event::new_event_handle<MyEvent>(account);\n        event::emit_event(&event_handle, MyEvent { message });\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example:\n- The `MyEvent` struct defines the event structure.\n- The `emit_event` function emits an event with a message.\n### 3. Deploy Your Module to Testnet\nYou need to publish your Move module to the Aptos Testnet. Follow these steps:\n1. Use the Aptos CLI to compile your module.\n2. Deploy the module to your Testnet account.\nRefer to the guide: [Your First Move Module](https://aptos.dev/en/build/guides).\n### 4. Query Events Using Aptos Explorer or API\nOnce your module emits events during a transaction, you can read them through the following methods:\n#### a. **Using Aptos Explorer**\n1. Navigate to the [Aptos Explorer](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/).\n2. Search for the account address where your contract is deployed.\n3. Look for the \"Events\" tab to view the events emitted by transactions.\n#### b. **Using the Aptos API**\nYou can programmatically query events using the Aptos API. Here's an example using the REST API:\n**Request:**\n```bash\ncurl \"https://testnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/accounts/<account_address>/events/<event_handle_path>\"\n```\n- Replace `<account_address>` with the address of the account where the module is deployed.\n- Replace `<event_handle_path>` with the path to the `EventHandle` in your module.\nFor example:\n```bash\ncurl \"https://testnet.aptoslabs.com/v1/accounts/0x1234.../events/0x1234...::MyModule::MyEvent\"\n```\n#### c. **Using SDKs**\nYou can use Aptos SDKs (e.g., TypeScript or Python SDKs) to query events. For example, in TypeScript:\n```typescript\nimport { AptosClient } from \"aptos\";\nconst client = new AptosClient(\"https://testnet.aptoslabs.com\");\nconst events = await client.getEventsByEventHandle(\n    \"0x1234...\", // Account address\n    \"0x1234...::MyModule::MyEvent\", // Struct type\n    \"event_handle_field_name\" // Event handle field name\n);\nconsole.log(events);\n```\n### 5. Explore the Event Details\nThe queried events will include details such as:\n- The event type (struct).\n- The data payload (e.g., `message` in the example above).\n- The transaction hash and sequence number.\nFor more information on event querying, refer to the official API documentation: [Aptos API Reference](https://aptos.dev/en/rest-api).\n---\nFor further discussions or questions about Move, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

      "ai_answer": "To set up and debug a local Aptos network for testing your smart contracts, you can utilize the Aptos CLI and Docker. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n---\n### 1. **Install and Configure the Aptos CLI**\nThe Aptos CLI is a critical tool for interacting with the Aptos blockchain. It allows you to compile and test Move contracts, manage nodes, and run private networks.\nFollow the instructions to install and configure the CLI: [Install and Configure the Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli).\n---\n### 2. **Initialize Local Configuration and Create an Account**\nBefore running a local network, initialize the local configuration and create an account on the Aptos blockchain. This step ensures that your CLI is properly configured to interact with the network.\nRefer to the guide: [Initialize Local Configuration and Create an Account](https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli/setup-cli).\n---\n### 3. **Run a Local Development Network**\nYou can run a local development network (localnet) using the Aptos CLI. This localnet operates independently of other Aptos networks (e.g., devnet) and is ideal for testing and debugging.\n#### Using the CLI to Run a Localnet:\n1. Install Docker on your machine if it's not already installed.\n2. Use the CLI command to start a localnet:\n   ```bash\n   aptos node run-local-testnet --with-faucet\n   ```\n   This command will:\n   - Start a single validator node.\n   - Launch a Faucet service attached to the localnet, allowing you to mint test tokens for your account.\n3. Once the localnet is running, you can interact with it using the Aptos CLI, such as deploying Move contracts or testing transactions.\nFor detailed instructions, refer to: [Run a Local Development Network with the CLI](https://aptos.dev/en/network/nodes/localnet/local-development-network).\n---\n### 4. **Run a Localnet Using Aptos-Core Source Code**\nIf you are testing modifications to the Aptos-core codebase or Aptos Framework, you can run a localnet directly from the source code. This method is more advanced and requires familiarity with the Aptos-core repository.\n---\n### 5. **Deploy and Debug Smart Contracts**\nOnce your localnet is running, you can deploy and debug your Move smart contracts:\n1. Compile your Move contracts using the CLI:\n   ```bash\n   aptos move compile --package-dir <path_to_package>\n   ```\n2. Publish the compiled package to your localnet:\n   ```bash\n   aptos move publish --package-dir <path_to_package> --url http://127.0.0.1:8080 --profile local\n   ```\n3. Interact with your deployed contracts by submitting transactions or querying the state using the CLI.\n---\n### 6. **Access the Faucet**\nIf you started the localnet with the Faucet service, you can request test tokens for your account:\n```bash\naptos account fund-with-faucet --account <your_account_address> --url http://127.0.0.1:8080\n```\n---\n### 7. **Debugging Tips**\n- Use the CLI to inspect the localnet logs to identify issues with transactions or contract execution.\n- Test your Move scripts and modules in isolation before deploying them to the localnet.\n- If you're running the localnet from source code, modify the `Aptos-core` repository to include debugging statements for deeper insights.\n---\nFor further discussions or questions about smart contract, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

      "ai_answer": "To start a Move package from a template on Aptos, follow these steps:\n### 1. Initialize a Move Package\nRun the following command to initialize a package using a predefined template. For example, to use the `hello-blockchain` template:\n```bash\naptos move init --name hello_blockchain --template hello-blockchain\n```\nThis command will create a new Move package with the following structure:\n- A `sources` directory containing the `hello_blockchain.move` file, which serves as a starting point for your development.\n- A `Move.toml` file that defines the package configuration.\n### 2. Explore the Template\nThe `hello_blockchain.move` file inside the `sources` directory contains example code to help you get started. You can view the file and modify it as needed for your project. The file provides a basic example of a Move smart contract.\n### 3. See All Available Templates\nTo view all available templates and get additional help with initializing a package, run:\n```bash\naptos move init --help\n```\nThis will display a list of templates and useful options for package initialization.\n### Example Directory Structure\nAfter initializing a package, your project directory structure will look like this:\n```\n<PROJECT_NAME>/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Move.toml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 sources/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 hello_blockchain.move\n```\nFor more details on starting a Move package, you can refer to the official documentation: [Start a Move package from a template](https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli).\nFor further discussions or questions about Move, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

      "ground_truth": "To create a fungible asset controlled by an Aptos framework multisig account, you first need a well-designed smart contract based on the fungible asset standard. An example code for this is available in the `aptos-core` repo. You need to clone this repo and navigate to the `managed_fungible_asset` directory. Then, publish this package onto your `default` account using CLI. Do the same for `multisig_managed_coin` package which calls functions defined in `managed_fungible_asset`. Make sure both modules are published on the same address. Also, ensure your account is funded before publishing modules. After publishing, you can start the `multisig_managed_coin` example and run it.",

      ],
      "ai_answer": "To create and manage a fungible asset with a multisig account in Aptos, you can follow these steps:\n---\n### Step 1: Understand Prerequisites\nBefore proceeding, ensure you are familiar with:\n1. Publishing Move modules on Aptos.\n2. The Aptos framework multisig account.\nIt is also recommended to try the [Your First Move Module](https://aptos.dev/en/build/guides/first-move-module) tutorial to get comfortable with Move module creation and deployment.\n---\n### Step 2: Clone the Aptos Core Repository\nThe Aptos team provides example code for creating and managing fungible assets. Start by cloning the `aptos-core` repository:\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:aptos-labs/aptos-core.git ~/aptos-core\n```\n---\n### Step 3: Publish Required Modules\nYou need to publish two modules: `managed_fungible_asset` and `multisig_managed_coin`. These modules are designed to work together to create and manage a fungible asset controlled by a multisig account.\n#### 3.1 Publish the `managed_fungible_asset` Module\nNavigate to the `managed_fungible_asset` directory and publish the package to your account:\n```bash\ncd ~/aptos-core/aptos-move/move-examples/fungible_asset/managed_fungible_asset\naptos move publish --named-addresses example_addr=default\n```\n#### 3.2 Publish the `multisig_managed_coin` Module\nNext, navigate to the `multisig_managed_coin` directory and publish this package as well:\n```bash\ncd ~/aptos-core/aptos-move/move-examples/fungible_asset/multisig_managed_coin\naptos move publish --named-addresses example_addr=default\n```\n> **Note:** The `multisig_managed_coin` module depends on the `managed_fungible_asset` module and must call its functions. Therefore, both modules must be published on the same account.\n---\n### Step 4: Fund Your Account\nBefore publishing the modules, ensure your account is funded with sufficient Aptos tokens. You can use the Aptos faucet for this purpose.\n---\n### Step 5: Manage the Fungible Asset with Multisig\nOnce the modules are published, you can use the multisig account to manage the fungible asset. This includes administrative operations such as:\n- Minting tokens\n- Transferring tokens\n- Burning tokens\n- Freezing or unfreezing accounts\nThe multisig setup enhances the security margin for managing assets by requiring multiple approvals for administrative actions.\n---\n### Step 6: Customize for Your Needs\nThis tutorial demonstrates an end-to-end flow for creating and managing fungible assets using a multisig account. However, you can create your own custom module and use the Aptos SDK to design an administration schema tailored to your specific requirements.\n---\nFor further discussions or questions about account, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",

      "ground_truth": "Third-party dependencies are external modules that a controlled module interacts with. They can be important if your smart contract needs to interact with other on-chain entities. For example, a multi-DEX router utilizes third-party dependencies to consolidate multiple DEX interactions into a single transaction.\n\nYou can specify third-party dependencies in the `Move.toml` file of your Move package. By default, `Move.toml` includes `AptosFramework` as a git repository dependency. When you run Aptos CLI commands, updates to the dependency are automatically retrieved and compiled against.\n\nWhen sourcing dependencies, consider their reliability and available information. Source code that is verified against the on-chain deployed module, like the Git Repository and Local Source Code, should always be preferred. You can include third-party source code in the `sources` directory, treating it the same as custom code. If neither of those are available, there are other options to depend on usable code, like decompiled code, bytecode, and ABI-crafted code.",

      "ai_answer": "Handling third-party dependencies in your Move smart contract requires careful consideration to ensure security, reliability, and maintainability. Here are the key steps and considerations:\n### 1. **Understanding Third-Party Dependencies**\nThird-party dependencies refer to external Move modules that your controlled module interacts with. These modules typically exist under different accounts and are not directly under your control.\n### 2. **Sourcing Third-Party Dependencies**\nWhen sourcing third-party dependencies, their reliability and the availability of information about them can vary significantly. To ensure the integrity of your smart contract, follow these guidelines:\n- **Preferred Sources:**\n  - **Verified Source Code:** Always prioritize source code that is verified against the on-chain deployed module. Examples include:\n    - [Git Repository](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts#git-repository)\n    - [Local Source Code](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts#local-source-code)\n- **Fallback Options:**\n  If verified source code is unavailable, consider these alternatives:\n  - [Decompiled Code](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts#decompiled-code)\n  - [Bytecode](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts#bytecode)\n  - [ABI-Crafted Code](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts#abi)\n### 3. **Key Considerations**\nWhen integrating third-party dependencies, keep the following considerations in mind:\n- **Security Risks:** External modules may introduce vulnerabilities into your smart contract. Ensure you audit the code thoroughly or use trusted and widely adopted modules.\n- **Documentation:** Some third-party dependencies may lack proper documentation. This can make it harder to understand the logic or changes if the module is refactored.\n- **Versioning and Updates:** Modules may be updated or refactored over time, potentially breaking your integration. Ensure you account for version control and compatibility.\n- **Testing:** Rigorously test interactions with third-party modules in a controlled environment to identify potential issues before deploying your contract.\n### Example Scenario\nSuppose you are building a payment module that interacts with an external token module. You should:\n1. Verify the source code of the token module against its on-chain deployment.\n2. Review the module's documentation (if available) and understand its API.\n3. Test your payment module with the external token module in a staging environment.\n4. Monitor for updates or changes to the token module that might impact your integration.\nBy following these practices, you can minimize the risks associated with third-party dependencies and maintain the robustness of your Move smart contract.\nFor further discussions or questions about Move, you can explore the [Aptos Dev Discussions](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-developer-discussions/discussions).\n",
