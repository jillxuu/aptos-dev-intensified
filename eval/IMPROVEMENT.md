# Potential Improvements for Aptos Developer RAG System

- Tune the similarity threshold (try increasing from 0.2 to 0.3-0.4)
- Enhance keyword extraction by adding more Aptos-specific technical terms to priority vocabulary
- Expand the priority topics list with more Aptos technical concepts
- Add metadata tagging to explicitly mark content by SDK type (TypeScript, Python, Rust)
- Update chunking strategy to preserve code block integrity with their explanations
- Implement query expansion specifically for Aptos-related technical terms
- Try newer embedding models like OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` or `text-embedding-3-large`
- Adjust the MAX_CHUNKS_TO_RETURN value (try more than 5 for complex queries)
- Implement dynamic k values based on query complexity
- Add post-retrieval re-ranking using a more sophisticated relevance model
- Enhance citation mechanism to clearly mark sources in responses
- Add confidence scoring to indicate when system is uncertain about source citations
- Implement SDK-specific intent detection in the query processing
- Try embedding-based similarity instead of just keyword overlap
- Add hierarchical chunking (both specific and contextual chunks)
- Improve preprocessing to identify code blocks and keep them intact
- Add verification step to check if response actually aligns with retrieved sources
- Experiment with domain-specific embedding models for blockchain/Aptos content
- Add query classification to determine if question is about specific SDK or feature
- Use weighted retrieval to prioritize official documentation over community content
